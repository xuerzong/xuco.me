记录一下美好生活

1. Type in stuff on the left.
2. See the live updates on the right.

That's it. Pretty simple. There's also a drop-down option in the upper right to switch between various views:

- **Preview:** A live display of the generated HTML as it would render in a browser.
- **HTML Source:** The generated HTML before your browser makes it pretty.
- **Lexer Data:** What [marked] uses internally, in case you like gory stuff like this.
- **Quick Reference:** A brief run-down of how to format things using markdown.

## Why Markdown?

It's easy. It's not overly bloated, unlike HTML. Also, as the creator of [markdown] says,

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's
> formatting syntax is to make it as readable
> as possible. The idea is that a
> Markdown-formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without
> looking like it's been marked up with tags
> or formatting instructions.

## 概括

如何通过自己的手段完成地方地方

Ready to start writing? Either start changing stuff on the left or
[clear everything](/demo/?text=) with a simple click.

[markdown]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/

```js
import remark from 'remark';
import html from 'remark-html';
import prism from 'remark-prism';

export default async function markdownToHtml(markdown) {
  const result = await remark().use(html).use(prism).process(markdown);
  return result.toString();
}
```
